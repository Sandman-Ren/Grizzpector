```/inspect```: inspects the current user's Splatoon 3 Eggstrawork shift and scores it using a hard-coded scoring function:
```javascript
const scoreFunction = (powerEggs: number,
                        goldenEggs: number,
                        goldenEggsAssists: number,
                        defeatEnemyCount: number,
                        rescueCount: number,
                        rescuedCount: number) => {
    return (
        powerEggs * 1.0 + goldenEggs * 100.0 + goldenEggsAssists * 20.0 +
        300.0 * defeatEnemyCount +
        50.0 * rescueCount + (-100.0) * rescuedCount
    );
};
```
Planned updates to add support for custom scoring functions.
By default, Grizzpector's response to this command is only visible to the command invoker. This can be changed by adding the `public` option and setting the value to `true`.
- options:
  - ```/inspect public <True/False>```: sets the visibility of Grizzpector's response. When `True`, Grizzpector's response is visible to everyone in the channel. When `False`, Grizzpector's response is only visible to the command invoker.
